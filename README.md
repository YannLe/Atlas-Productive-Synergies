# Atlas of Productive Synergies

### What if Artificial Intelligence helped us build a more sustainable industry? #

The recent health and geopolitical crises highlighted the fragility of our European industrial policies. The current awareness opens the way to a model of sustainable re-industrialization that combines resilience, societal and environmental commitment and economic performance.

Open data, associated with Artificial Intelligence offers new perspectives for building a twin of the French productive system bringing together both macro-economic data and real observations on companies. This offers a powerful tool to identify industrial know-how and Global Value Chains (GVC). 

The **Atlas of Productive Synergies** (<https://atlas.productive-synergies.com/>) is our experimental platform to develop and evaluate our research on industrial resilience ([Video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmKzEqd6fa0 "Video presentation")).

You will find in this project several use cases: 
* identify alternative local suppliers to replace imports ;
* propose new diversification opportunities for companies;
* Assess the level of resilience of each company;
* to take into account the HR dimension in order to pilot training offers and to recommend the most appropriate territory in which to relocate a company.
