# Atlas-Productive-Synergies
What if Artificial Intelligence helped us build a more sustainable industry?

The recent health and geopolitical crises highlighted the fragility of our European industrial policies. The current awareness opens the way to a model of sustainable re-industrialization that combines resilience, societal and environmental commitment and economic performance.

Open data, associated with Artificial Intelligence offers new perspectives for building a twin of the French productive system bringing together both macro-economic data and real observations on companies. This offers a powerful tool to identify industrial know-how and Global Value Chains (GVC). 

The Atlas of Productive Synergies is our experimental platform to develop and evaluate our research on industrial resilience.

You will find in this project several use cases: 
- identify alternative local suppliers to replace imports ;
- propose new diversification opportunities for companies;
- Assess the level of resilience of each company;
- to take into account the HR dimension in order to pilot training offers and to recommend the most appropriate territory in which to relocate a company.
